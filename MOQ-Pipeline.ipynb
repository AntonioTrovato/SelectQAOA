    "# SelectQAOA: Regression Test Case Selection Using QAOAs\n",
    "Regression testing is an important part of the software development process in software engineering. It is a practice aimed at identifying any regression, which is the emergence of new defects or issues in a software application following changes, enhancements, or updates made to the source code. In other words, regression testing focuses on how changes made to the software can affect the correct behavior of existing features. Regression testing is particularly important in agile software development environments, where changes are made frequently and rapidly. This practice helps ensure that the software remains stable and reliable as it evolves over time. Ideal regression testing would re-run all the available test cases of a given software system. However, in addition to being potentially very costly, this could even be impractical in some case. In this scenario, test case selection is one of the most widely investigated test suite optimization approaches.\n",
    "Test case selection focuses on selecting a subset from an initial test suite to test software changes, i.e., to test whether unmodified parts of a program continue to work correctly after changes involving other parts. Furthermore, while in Test Case Minimization, not selecting a test case means permanently removing it; in Test Case Selection, the identified subset of the starting test suite is bounded to a specific execution of regression testing. Various techniques, such as Integer Programming, symbolic execution, data flow analysis, dependence graph-based methods, and flow graph-based approaches, can be employed to identify the modified portions of the software. Once test cases covering the unchanged program segments are pinpointed using a specific technique, an optimization algorithm (e.g., additional greedy, DIV-GA,\n",
    "SelectQA, BootQA or SelectQAOA) can select a minimal set of these test cases based on certain testing criteria (e.g., branch coverage). The ultimate aim is to reduce the expenses associated with regression testing.\n",

    "## Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)\n",
    "The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm designed to tackle combinatorial optimization problems by combining classical and quantum computing techniques. It encodes the optimization problem into a Quantum Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) format and constructs a parameterized quantum circuit that alternates between applying the problem Hamiltonian, which represents the optimization goal, and a mixing Hamiltonian, which promotes exploration of the solution space. The parameters of this circuit are optimized using classical optimization methods to maximize the likelihood of measuring the optimal solution. Once the parameters are tuned, the circuit is executed on a quantum device or simulator to get candidate solutions, making QAOA particularly suitable for NP-hard problems like graph partitioning and maximum cut. This hybrid approach highlights the potential of quantum computing to provide advantages in solving complex optimization challenges."

    "Therefore, the test suites to optimize are decomposed into smaller sub-suites solvable by QAOA simulators using clustering techniques. Applying clustering allows for preserving the similarities between test cases in sub-suites, and since similar test cases tend to have redundant coverage, the optimization process will facilitate useless duplications. Also, the similarities between test cases of the same clusters imply a diversified representation of the initial suite, facilitating targeted balancing of the goal while building a diversified final sub-suite.\n",

    "## Optimal Multi-Objective SelectQAOA Depth\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we want to analyze whether the depth of the circuit of QAOA affects SelectQAOA. To do this, we have executed 10 independent times SelectQAOA on an IDEAL QAOA simulator for different depth values (1, 2, 4, 8, and 16) for each of the examined SIR programs. Then, we applied the Kruskal-Wallis H-test, to see if SelectQAOA behaves differently with different depth values. Finally, we used the Vargha-Delaney's $\\hat{A}_{12}$ effect size to estimate the differences between the observations and identify the best configuration for the depth parameter.\n",

    "The **Statevector Simulator** in Qiskit Aer is a high-precision quantum circuit simulator that represents the full quantum state of a system. In particular, it is a literal state vector or density matrix in a linear algebra sense, to obtain an exact simulation with no involved noise that applies the necessary rounding when performing floating-point operations. It is useful for **simulating ideal quantum circuits** without noise, decoherence, or measurement effects.\n"

    "## Effectiveness Empirical Evaluations\n",
    "The four algorithms were evaluated in terms of their **effectiveness**. In particular, we built a **reference Pareto front** made by all the **non-dominated solutions** found by all the algorithms during all ten runs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $P = \\{ P_1, ..., P_l \\}$ be the set of \\( $l$ \\) different Pareto fronts obtained after all the experiment runs by all the evaluated algorithms. The **reference Pareto front** $P_{\\text{ref}}$ is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$P_{\\text{ref}} \\subseteq \\bigcup_{i=1}^{l} P_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\forall p \\in P_{\\text{ref}}, \\nexists q \\in P_{\\text{ref}}: q > p$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the reference front, we computed as an **effectiveness metric** the **number of non-dominated solutions**, i.e., the number of non-dominated solutions found by an algorithm selected for the final reference front.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the empirical reliability of the results, we used the **Mann-Whitney U test** and the **Vargha-Delaney effect size** $\\hat{A}_{12}$. The null hypothesis, i.e., there is **no statistically significant difference** between the effectiveness of the algorithms, is rejected if p-values < 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Dunn's Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Kruskal-Wallis H-test** is a non-parametric statistical test used to determine whether there are significant differences between three or more independent groups. However, while the test can indicate that at least one group differs, it does not specify which groups are different from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we apply **Dunn's Test**, a post-hoc pairwise comparison method that helps identify which specific groups differ. This test compares all possible pairs of groups to determine which ones have statistically significant differences. Since multiple comparisons increase the chance of false positives, Dunn's test is often used with a correction method such as Bonferroni or Holm to adjust p-values. If the adjusted p-value is below the significance threshold (typically 0.05), we conclude that the two compared groups are significantly different.\n",
